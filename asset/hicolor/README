hicolor icons for freedesktop.org systems, including most Linux and BSD distros.

This file will not be included in the installation.

 - App icons should have the same name as the executable and be prefixed with "size/apps/".
 - Filetype icons should be named after the MimeType and be prefixed with "size/mimetypes".

The icon in 48x48/apps/ will also be added to /usr/share/pixmaps for extra compatibility.

Common size names include:

  scalable, 16x16, 20x20, 22x22,
  24x24, 32x32, 36x36, 40x40,
  48x48, 64x64, 72x72, 96x96,
  128x128, 192x192, 256x256, 384x384,
